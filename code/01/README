h2. Overview

This project will try and solve the very simple genetic algorithm problem
described in this site:
http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat3.html

That is to use a GA to construct a genotype consisting of alternative 
numbers and mathematical operators to reach a target number.

h2. Planning

What do we need:

Object: Genes which are encodings of number and operators
Object: A genotype which consists of a string of genes

Function: For evaluating genotypes to make the phenotype
Function: For determining the fitness of a phenotype

Function: For selecting the genotypes to mate
Function: For mating genotypes to produce the next generation
